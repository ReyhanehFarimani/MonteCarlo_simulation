Single Component Ideal Gas Description : Tests the simulation for an ideal gas with no interactions. Expected Outcome : Particle numbers fluctuate around the mean as per the chemical potential and temperature. Results : 2. Lennard-Jones Fluid Description : Simulates a fluid using the Lennard-Jones potential. Expected Outcome : The density should match known values for Lennard-Jones fluids under specific conditions. 3. Hard Sphere Fluid Description : Simulates a system of hard spheres. Expected Outcome : The radial distribution function (g(r)) should follow theoretical predictions. (Add the other scenarios similarly...) Testing the Scenarios Each scenario should be run individually. The results should be compared with analytical or published data where applicable.","title":"Test Scenarios"},{"location":"test_scenarios/#test-scenarios","text":"Below are the test scenarios used to validate the GCMC simulation code:","title":"Test Scenarios"},{"location":"test_scenarios/#1-single-component-ideal-gas","text":"Description : Tests the simulation for an ideal gas with no interactions.
